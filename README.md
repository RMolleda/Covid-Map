# Covid map flask server

In contribution with my partners <b>Estela</b> and <b>Kapil</b>, there is a server that show you in real time the Covid worldwide map with the actual features:
- Total cases per region of countries.
- Total recovers.
- Total deaths.

To execute this, u have to download all the repo and execute in terminal. Then access by localhost:1919

Thank you.
